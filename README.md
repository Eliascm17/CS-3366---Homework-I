## The reason it is bad is because the layout is not as good as it could be. While the funcitonality is there, the layout is not the best.

# Part B:
* List cases and rare cases:
  - Going all the way up
  - Going all the way down
  - "Deciding whether to do one or the other"
 * The interface makes use for these cases but it doesn't do it as well as if could. my making the design a but more simplified and having the buttons near the display may help the user understand more easily where they are going.

* The common sequence of using an elevator:
  1. Walk in and press either a floor or the close door button
  2. Then wait until the doors close and the elevator starts moving
  3. Finally you get to your desired floor and exit when you arrive. 
  
* For the most part, most users think when approaching an elevator interface that all they need to do is press a button (floor number), and at some point in the ride they will get to their desired floor.

* Most elevators provide user feedback by use of:
  - Sounds i.e. dings and bells
  - Visual ques
  
* A common mistake when implementing your own design could be making it too complicated for any user to understand. More specifically mistakenly implementing sensory overload or not providing enough information for the user to go about using the interface. 

## My own implementation of an elevator's UI:
